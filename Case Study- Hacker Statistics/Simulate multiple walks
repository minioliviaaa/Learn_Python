Simulate multiple walks

Example_1:

Initialize all_walks to an empty list.
Fill in the specification of the for loop so that the random walk is simulated 10 times.
At the end of the top-level for loop, append random_walk to the all_walks list.
Finally, after the top-level for loop, print out all_walks.

# Initialization
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)

# Initialize all_walks
all_walks = []

# Simulate random walk 10 times
for i in range(10) :

    # Code from before
    random_walk = [0]
    for x in range(100) :
        step = random_walk[-1]
        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

        if dice <= 2:
            step = max(0, step - 1)
        elif dice <= 5:
            step = step + 1
        else:
            step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)
        random_walk.append(step)

    # Append random_walk to all_walks
    all_walks.append(random_walk)

# Print all_walks
print(all_walks)

Visualize all walks

Example_2:

Use np.array() to convert all_walks to a Numpy array, np_aw.
Try to use plt.plot() on np_aw. Also include plt.show(). Does it work out of the box?
Transpose np_aw by calling np.transpose() on np_aw. Call the result np_aw_t. 
Now every row in np_all_walks represents the position after 1 throw for the 10 random walks.
Use plt.plot() to plot np_aw_t; also include a plt.show(). Does it look better this time?

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
all_walks = []
for i in range(10) :
    random_walk = [0]
    for x in range(100) :
        step = random_walk[-1]
        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)
        if dice <= 2:
            step = max(0, step - 1)
        elif dice <= 5:
            step = step + 1
        else:
            step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)
        random_walk.append(step)
    all_walks.append(random_walk)

# Convert all_walks to Numpy array: np_aw
np_aw=np.array(all_walks)

# Plot np_aw and show
plt.plot(np_aw)
plt.show()

# Clear the figure
plt.clf()

# Transpose np_aw: np_aw_t
np_aw_t=np.transpose(np_aw)

# Plot np_aw_t and show
plt.plot(np_aw_t)
plt.show()

Implement clumsiness

Example_3:

With this neatly written code of yours, changing the number of times the random walk should be simulated is super-easy. 
You simply update the range() function in the top-level for loop.

There's still something we forgot! You're a bit clumsy and you have a 0.1% chance of falling down. 
That calls for another random number generation. Basically, you can generate a random float between 0 and 1. 
If this value is less than or equal to 0.001, you should reset step to 0.

Change the range() function so that the simulation is performed 250 times.
Finish the if condition so that step is set to 0 if a random float is less or equal to 0.001. Use np.random.rand().

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
all_walks = []

# Simulate random walk 250 times
for i in range(250) :
    random_walk = [0]
    for x in range(100) :
        step = random_walk[-1]
        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)
        if dice <= 2:
            step = max(0, step - 1)
        elif dice <= 5:
            step = step + 1
        else:
            step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

        # Implement clumsiness
        if np.random.rand()<=0.001 :
            step = 0

        random_walk.append(step)
    all_walks.append(random_walk)

# Create and plot np_aw_t
np_aw_t = np.transpose(np.array(all_walks))
plt.plot(np_aw_t)
plt.show()

Plot the distribution

Example_4:

To make sure we've got enough simulations, go crazy. Simulate the random walk 500 times.
From np_aw_t, select the last row. This contains the endpoint of all 500 random walks you've simulated. 
Store this Numpy array as ends.
Use plt.hist() to build a histogram of ends. Don't forget plt.show() to display the plot.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
all_walks = []

# Simulate random walk 500 times
for i in range(500) :
    random_walk = [0]
    for x in range(100) :
        step = random_walk[-1]
        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)
        if dice <= 2:
            step = max(0, step - 1)
        elif dice <= 5:
            step = step + 1
        else:
            step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)
        if np.random.rand() <= 0.001 :
            step = 0
        random_walk.append(step)
    all_walks.append(random_walk)

# Create and plot np_aw_t
np_aw_t = np.transpose(np.array(all_walks))

# Select last row from np_aw_t: ends
ends=np_aw_t[-1]

# Plot histogram of ends, display plot
plt.hist(ends)
plt.show()
