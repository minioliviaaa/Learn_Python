Random float

Randomness has many uses in science, art, statistics, cryptography, gaming, gambling, and other fields. 
You're going to use randomness to simulate a game.

All the functionality you need is contained in the random package, a sub-package of numpy. 
In this exercise, you'll be using two functions from this package:

seed(): sets the random seed, so that your results are the reproducible between simulations. 
As an argument, it takes an integer of your choosing. If you call the function, no output will be generated.
rand(): if you don't specify any arguments, it generates a random float between zero and one.

Example_1:

Import numpy as np.
Use seed() to set the seed; as an argument, pass 123.
Generate your first random float with rand() and print it out.

# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# Set the seed
np.random.seed(123)

# Generate and print random float
print(np.random.rand())

<script.py> output:
    0.6964691855978616
    
    
Example_2:

Use randint() with the appropriate arguments to randomly generate the integer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. This simulates a dice. Print it out.
Repeat the outcome to see if the second throw is different. Again, print out the result.

# Import numpy and set seed
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)

# Use randint() to simulate a dice
print(np.random.randint(1,7))

# Use randint() again
print(np.random.randint(1,7))

<script.py> output:
    6
    3
    
Example_3:

Roll the dice. Use randint() to create the variable dice.
Finish the if-elif-else construct by replacing ___:
If dice is 1 or 2, you go one step down.
if dice is 3, 4 or 5, you go one step up.
Else, you throw the dice again. The number of eyes is the number of steps you go up.
Print out dice and step. Given the value of dice, was step updated correctly?

# Import numpy and set seed
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)

# Starting step
step = 50

# Roll the dice
dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

# Finish the control construct
if dice <= 2 :
    step = step - 1
elif dice <= 5 :
    step = step + 1
else:
    step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)
    
# Print out dice and step    
print(dice)
print(step)

<script.py> output:
    6
    53
