Loop over dictionary

In Python 3, you need the items() method to loop over a dictionary:

world = { "afghanistan":30.55, 
          "albania":2.77,
          "algeria":39.21 }

for key, value in world.items() :
    print(key + " -- " + str(value))
    

Example_1:
Write a for loop that goes through each key:value pair of europe. 
On each iteration, "the capital of x is y" should be printed out, where x is the key and y is the value of the pair.

# Definition of dictionary
europe = {'spain':'madrid', 'france':'paris', 'germany':'bonn', 
          'norway':'oslo', 'italy':'rome', 'poland':'warsaw', 'australia':'vienna' }
          
# Iterate over europe
for key,value in europe.items():
    print("the capital of " + key + " is " + str(value))
    
    <script.py> output:
    the capital of italy is rome
    the capital of spain is madrid
    the capital of poland is warsaw
    the capital of australia is vienna
    the capital of france is paris
    the capital of norway is oslo
    the capital of germany is bonn

Loop over Numpy array

If you're dealing with a 1D Numpy array, looping over all elements can be as simple as:

for x in my_array :
    ...
If you're dealing with a 2D Numpy array, it's more complicated. 
A 2D array is built up of multiple 1D arrays. 
To explicitly iterate over all separate elements of a multi-dimensional array, you'll need this syntax:

for x in np.nditer(my_array) :
    ...
Two Numpy arrays that you might recognize from the intro course are available in your Python session: np_height, 
a Numpy array containing the heights of Major League Baseball players, and np_baseball, 
a 2D Numpy array that contains both the heights (first column) and weights (second column) of those players.

Example_2:

Import the numpy package under the local alias np.
Write a for loop that iterates over all elements in np_height and prints out "x inches" for each element, 
where x is the value in the array.
Write a for loop that visits every element of the np_baseball array and prints it out.

# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# For loop over np_height
for x in np_height :
    print(str(x) + " inches")

# For loop over np_baseball
for x in np.nditer(np_baseball) :
    print(x)
