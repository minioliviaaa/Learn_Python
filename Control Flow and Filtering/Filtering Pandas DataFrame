Example_1:
Extract the drives_right column as a Pandas Series and store it as dr.
Use dr, a boolean Series, to subset the cars DataFrame. Store the resulting selection in sel.
Print sel, and assert that drives_right is True for all observations.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Extract drives_right column as Series: dr
dr=cars["drives_right"]

# Use dr to subset cars: sel
sel=cars[dr]

# Print sel
print(sel)

#Convert the code on the right to a one-liner that calculates the variable sel as before.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Convert code to a one-liner
sel = cars[cars['drives_right']]

# Print sel
print(sel)

Example_2:
Remember about np.logical_and(), np.logical_or() and np.logical_not(), 
the Numpy variants of the and, or and not operators? You can also use them on Pandas Series to do more advanced filtering operations.
Take this example that selects the observations that have a cars_per_cap between 10 and 80. 
Try out these lines of code step by step to see what's happening.

cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
between = np.logical_and(cpc > 10, cpc < 80)
medium = cars[between]

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Import numpy, you'll need this
import numpy as np

# Create medium: observations with cars_per_cap between 100 and 500
medium= cars[np.logical_and(cars["cars_per_cap"]>100,cars["cars_per_cap"]<500)]

# Print medium
print(medium)

    cars_per_cap country drives_right
RU           200  Russia         True

<script.py> output:
        cars_per_cap country drives_right
    RU           200  Russia         True
